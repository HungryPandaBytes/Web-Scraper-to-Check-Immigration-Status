ULTIMATE GOAL: get a better picture of the processing time of my ead card 


1. how to quickly parse a string to find if it's a form I'm interested in 
    SOLUTION: 'a nice string'.includes('nice', 2) //true
2. create a cron job to parse through many requests per day 
3. make a chart using material ui and chartjs 
4. notify me when it's getting closer to my receipt date that apps are processing 


Forms I'm interested in: 

Form I-765: Employment 
Form I-131: Travel Doc
Form I-485: Application to Register Permanent Residence
Form I-130: Petition for Alien Relative

Messages I'm interested in: 
"the Post Office delivered your new card"
"we mailed your new card for your Form I-485"
